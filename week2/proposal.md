## Technical Report Project

### Proposal

***
**Background and Message**

Wrath and Glory released by Ulisses Spiele is a pen-and-paper tabletop roleplaying game (RPG), the same genre as Dungeons & Dragons.
While the basic game system has been met with moderate to positive reception within the Warhammer 40,000 (hereafter referred to as "WH40k") community, the book's organization, layout, and flow have all been criticized. 
Important game mechanics and details are often hidden in relatively obscure locations and a lack of general clarity has led to some disagreement about the nature of certain rules, which causes controversy in the player base. 

I intend to create a revised version of a section of the book in order to increase clarity, accessibility, and ease of reference. As a rulebook, it is important that important sections be easy to find and information should be as concentrated as possible. 
What I plan to rework are the sections that involve character creation. Going by the page numbers in the book itself, this would be pages 46-201. While this may seem like a large amount of content to rework, I would not be adding or subtracting content, merely modifying its location within the book in order to improve the layout and flow. I may clarify game rules or take into account released FAQs, but my approach is intended to be as an employee of the company asked to fix the layout problems the community complains about.
I plan to reference the press releases and FAQs released by the company in order to assist my efforts, and include changes made by the FAQs into my revised edition.

**Users/Audience**

The general audience of the project would be Warhammer 40,000 fans and Tabletop RPG fans, specifically people who are frustrated by the current state of the existing rulebook.
This would consist mostly of people of the 18+ age demographic, as the game's setting is not child-friendly, but it would also be people familiar with the setting and the existing book, meaning that they would have something to compare the revised work to.

**GDA Table**

|    | Goals  |  Deliverables | Audience |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Requirements**  |  Make sections of the Core Rulebook (CRB) more easily read and interpreted | An edited version of the Wrath and Glory CRB  | Increased accessibility of the CRB by first-time players  |
|  **Preferences** | A rulebook that isn't as confusing to read nor as difficult to use as a reference | A refined character creation process and sections for easy reference during play  | Ease of access and easy "pick up and play" capability  |
|  **Things to Avoid**| Removing existing content, adding new content | Changes that fundamentally change the game's rules  | Making the situation worse by making the book more complicated or impenetrable |
|  **Things in Common**| Increasing clarity of the book as a whole, increasing ease of use  |  Making as few changes as possible to content while making the layout and flow more effective | Increased acessibility and fun  |

**Basic Specifications**

The format of the revision will be a PDF document with formatting similar to that of the Wrath and Glory CRB, though certain aspects are not easily replicated without access to the assets owned by Ulisses Spiele.
The goal is to present the revision as an alternate version of the sections revised, hopefully replacing the existing sections entirely in the eyes of the audience.

The document would be reduced from the source material, which is around 150 pages. I expect that a quarter to a third of that is lore. After revision, I expect to end up with a document of around 100 pages.

By the first benchmark, I hope to have revised the sections pertaining to the book's basic mechanics, Chapter 2: Rules (p.46-63). 

By the second benchmark, I would have gone from the beginning of Chapter 3: Character Creation to the beginning of "Select an Archetype" (p. 64-99). 

By the third benchmark, I would complete the remaining sections in the chapter, pages 100-201. I do not believe that this section will take me as long, as it is heavier with lore and non-mechanical content. 

I could also release the document in a digital format on Warhammer 40,000 forums or a wiki, in order to help it reach a larger audience.
